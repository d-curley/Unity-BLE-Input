# Unity_BLE_Network_Pipeline

Objective: This project has been driven by my obsession and vision to use physical objects and sensors in our world to control digital assets and environments for games and interactives. Combining my new Unity proficiency with my background in robotics, I have developed a pipeline to bring real life data into my Unity applications. I found IoT web APIs to be too slow to provide a sense of real-time interaction, so I pivoted to BLE which has proven to be seamless. The Arduino with BLE allows me to make my own custom controllers for players to engage in unique ways. Further, I can bring elements of the playerâ€™s real environment into their game, controlling game elements based on their lighting, sound, and even temperature of the room.

Description: Using Bluetooth Low Energy, this tool sends sensor data (in this case, spatial orientation)  from an Arduino into Unity, where that data can be stored and used to control the position of game objects. I have also incorporated Mirror, a free .NET framework from the Unity Asset Store. This allows multiple users at once to interact with and store that data as well. Thus, it works similar to the Internet of Things, where real world data can be shared and accessed anywhere, but instead of as a number on a dashboard, it can be visualized in an interactive digital environment.
